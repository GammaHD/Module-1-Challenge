# GMX Decentralized Perpetual Exchange

## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company?
   - GMX Exchange
* When was the company incorporated?
    - The protocol first went live on Arbitrum in September 2021
* Who are the founders of the company?
    - GMX is founded by an anonymous team. The team has a record of two other protocols they have built, XVIX and Gambit, both of which are successful.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    - The founders understood the importance of having ownership of your own keys/coins and having a community based project. They set out to combine the systems of defi with concepts of crypto exchanges. This led to the creation of a non-custodial perpetual exchange.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    - Given the nature of the team being anonymous it is hard to pinpoint exactly how the protocol was initially funded but as of now GMX has a Floor price Fund. This is a protocol owned liquidity pool that earns fees from the trading pair GMX/ETH. These fees are used to further grow the liquidity pool, marketing, and paying out stake holders/liquidity providers. The current fund size is 2.7 mil but total fees generated is 94 mil.

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - GMX protocol provides traders a decentralized way to spot and margin trade. Up to x30 leverage. While giving 100% of the fees generated to GMX stakers(30%) and LP providers(70%).
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    - Crypto leverage traders that prefer a decentralized platform. The crypto derivatives market is a mutil trillion dollar industry, surged to $4.51 trillion in July 2022. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    - GMX is on ETHs layer2 solution Arbitrum. This allows for faster and lower fees per transaction while trading. With the fees generated on the GMX platform it pays out stakers and LP providers with both native ETH and escrowed GMX. This allows the token to maintain a healthy price without token dumping. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
    - Arbitrum is the L2 scaling solution GMX is hosted on. It utilizes a technology known as optimistic rollup. This improves the speed and efficiency of the protocol by allowing Ethereum smart contracts to scale by sending messages between smart contracts on the Ethereum primary chain and Arbitrum’s L2 chain, having most of the transactions processing be completed on the L2 chain.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    - Cryptocurrencies/blockchain and derivatives markets.
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?
    - Increased price efficiency through data oracles like chainlink to insure price of leveraged and spot assets match their counterparts on centralized exchanges. Incentivise a means of passive income by staking or providing liquidity to the platform. The introduction of synthetic assets allows crypto traders a decentralized way into traditional markets and be able to own stocks on the blockchain.
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    - Other decentralized margin trading platforms include; dYdX, Mango, DDex, and Perpetual protocol.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    - Within a year GMX has grown into the largest non-custodial exchange. They average monthly 11.25m in fees generated and have a TVL(Total value locked) of 452.41m with a market cap of 506.47m. GMX has significantly helped the liquidity on Arbitrum grow. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
   - TVL on the platform, Fees generated, Revenue, Trading Volume and active users.
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    - GMX had explosive growth over the past year but given the nature of the bear market trading volume and active users have slowly dwindled. GMX out performs most of its competitors except dYdX exchange in trading volume. Despite higher trading volume on dYdX GMX has generated more revenue for its users over the past 30 days. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - Synthetic assets or allow GMX stakers and LP providers to be paid out in USDC.
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - With synthetic assets, as stated previously, allows crypto traders a decentralized way to buy stocks without going through a brokerage. Paying LP providers with USDC may incentivize others to join the platform. Some traders would rather their revenue paid out in a stable currency than ETH that can be volatile in price. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    - To have synthetic assets on the blockchain the protocol would need to use any sort of data oracle.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - Data oracles, such as Chainlink, bring data from off the blockchain and put it on the blockchain for smart contracts to use. Oracles can deliver real-time information such as exchange rates and price fluctuations. Without this data decentralized exchanges can be subjected to arbitrage exploits.
